# Timing Attack
- In cryptography, a timing attack is a type of side channel attack in which an attacker attempts to determine the password or secret key of a cryptosystem by analyzing the time it takes for the system to process various inputs.
- This type of attack exploits the fact that different inputs to a cryptographic algorithm can take different amounts of time to process, depending on the specific input.
- An attacker can measure the processing time for a number of different inputs, and use that information to try to determine the password or key that the system is using.
- For example, if the attacker knows that the password is a certain length, they can try different combinations of characters at that length, and measure the time it takes for the system to process each combination. If one combination takes significantly longer to process than the others, that may indicate that it is the correct password.
